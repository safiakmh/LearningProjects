# C++ Projects
This is a repository I use to solidify the new concepts I am learning in my current C++ class at Bowie State. 
As a part of my growing passion for programming, I am trying to go beyond the classroom and do C++ programs in my own time. 
The two examples I have up are a Rolling Dice Simulator and a MadLib Generator that implement the concepts I have learned 
so far in my C++ class. 

## Rolling Dice Simulator
The rolling dice simulator class allows users to simulate the game of rolling dice. After each iteration a new face of the
dice will be displayed to the user in the form of numbers 1-6. The user will be prompted on whether or not they would like
to continue rolling the dice. They can roll the dice as many times as they want until they would like to exit the game. 

## Madlib Generator
The madlib generator class simulates a game of MadLib. The program prompts users to input different fields like nouns, verbs,
people, food, etc. and then compiles all user input into a new story each time the program is run based on the user input.
